# amazonmq-poc--ui

Welcome! If you're viewing this readme in VS Code, you can start the app by hitting F5. From there, further documentation within the app will guide you through building the app, making api calls, our UI standards, and more.

## Running the app from the command line

A number of scripts are defined in `package.json` to simplify running from the command line. `npm start` will replicate starting the app with F5 but won't attach the VS Code debugger.

## Further help

Consult the in-app readme component for further information on your new app.
